          Coming from a background in professional photography, I first discovered my passion for UX/UI design while working for a startup company in the Bay Area. This being before I was even familiar with the term "UX", I was given the opportunity to be part of the design team and help design the first iterations of the their mobil app- which is now used by many today. This is where I fell in love with user experience and visual design. This memorable experience inspired me to go back to school to further my education in all things design. Since then I have completed two UX/UI design bootcamps and look forward to bringing my knowledge, passion and excitement for design to a workplace.
